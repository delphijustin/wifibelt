# wifibelt
A app that texts you when a new person gets on wifi via textbelt

To use it you must configure Wireless Network Watcher to run the following command:
<p>
<b>wscript wifibelt.vbs /company:%adapter_company% /mac:%mac_addr% /ip:%ip_addr%</b>
</p>
But before doing that you must modify wifibelt.vbs first.

You can also append the /debug:1 parameter to echo the JSON response.
